# Ravening

Abstract
Ravening is a Loot and Scoot Game featuring an Isometric Camera angle, procedurally generated dungeon and multiple entities variety. The goals of the game is amass wealth by finding treasures and survive until you can find merchant to sell your loots.

Description
In a faraway kingdom, a mysterious dungeon opened. The dungeons are split into floors of different biomes and designs filled with monsters and treasures.

The dungeon has its own magic. The space between floors is convoluted, entering a lower floor will move you to an entirely random part of the floor. A path connecting two floors does not connect the same part of the floors. Attempting to map the dungeon is impossible. The deeper you go, the greater your spoil but so is the oppressiveness of the dungeon. By the dungeonâ€™s magic, those that fell in the dungeon are returned to the foot of the dungeon and lose possession of items that belong to the dungeon.

The mysterious dungeon piqued the interest of the merchant guild. With a base camp in the entrance of the dungeon, the merchant guild has set up an extensive network of camps on multiple floors and established its own transport system within the dungeon despite the convoluted space. They buy loot and sell gear to adventurers. Adventurers try to conquer the dungeon, find loot and riches. They are referred to as ravens. This creates an ecosystem where adventurers explore and find loot and merchants buy and sell goods to the adventurers.

You, a newbie raven, walk into the dungeon hoping to find fortune. Explore a procedurally generated dungeon, acquire loots, avoid dangers and trade your loots with merchant.
